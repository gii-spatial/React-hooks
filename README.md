# ⚛️ React-hooks

Welcome to **React-hooks**
<br />
My personal stash of handy, reusable custom React hooks!
<br />
This repo is all about **storing custom React hooks** that I use across projects. 
<br />
Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, I keep these hooks here as a boilerplate to easily grab whenever I need it.

> **⚠️Note:**  
> These hooks were created and tested with the following versions:  
> - React: v19.1.0+  
> - Vitest: 3.2.4

## 👩‍💻 How to use

1. Pick the hook file/folder you want  
2. Import it into your React project
   * Install dependencies (if necessary)
4. Use it like any other React hook


## 🔄 Reusability

Want to reuse a hook?  
Just copy the file or the entire folder you need into your project — simple as that! 
No complicated installs or dependencies unless noted below.


## 📦 Dependencies

If a hook relies on **relative dependencies** (like helper functions or shared utils), or third-party npm packages, 
make sure to copy those files too, and install any required npm packages as mentioned in the hook’s notes.
