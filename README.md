# React-hooks ⚛️

Welcome to **React-hooks**
<br />
My personal stash of handy, reusable custom React hooks!


## 🚀 Purpose

This repo is all about **storing custom React hooks** that I use across projects. 
Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, I keep these hooks here as a boilerplate to easily grab whenever I need it.


## 🔄 Reusability

Want to reuse a hook?  
Just copy the file or the entire folder you need into your project — simple as that! 
No complicated installs or dependencies unless noted below.


## 📦 Dependencies

If a hook relies on **relative dependencies** (like helper functions or shared utils), or third-party npm packages, 
make sure to copy those files too, and install any required npm packages as mentioned in the hook’s notes.


## 👩‍💻 How to use

1. Pick the hook file/folder you want  
2. Import it into your React project
   * Install dependencies (if necessary)
4. Use it like any other React hook
